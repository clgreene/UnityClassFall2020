  dialogueList:
  - Do you drink alcohol or do any drugs, legal or illegal? Don't worry, you have
    doctor/patient confidentiality.
  - I smoke a little weed here and there, and I drink but never get blackout drunk.
  - Have you noticed your memory lapses coinciding with weed or alcohol usage?
  - I haven't paid attention to it.
  - Start paying attention, write down the date and time whenever you smoke or drink.
  - And that will help?
  - That will help us narrow down what it could be.
  - And then what?
  - And then come back in a couple weeks and check up and we'll see where we're at.
