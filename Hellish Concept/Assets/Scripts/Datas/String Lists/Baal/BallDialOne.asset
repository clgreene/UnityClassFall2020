  - ...F To Talk...
  - Another newly dead sinner. Welcome to Hell!
  - My name is Baal, and... Wait a second... You're no mortal! You're the Prince
    of Hell!
  - Old Lucifer banished you here huh? Sounds like the Devil.
  - Well, how about I help you out a bit.
  - The only way back to your throne is to battle your way back.
  - In order to do that, you're gonna need a beast, a Hellspawn.
  - As it so happens, I have a few right behind me in my shack.
  - Why don't you head in there an choose one.
  - Then come back and talk to me.
