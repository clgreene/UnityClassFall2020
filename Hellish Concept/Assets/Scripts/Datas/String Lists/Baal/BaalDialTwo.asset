  - ...F To Talk...
  - Great, now that you have your own hellspawn you need a monster to fight.
  - There are some monsters right here, only problem is they're all underground.
  - You're going to need to shovel to fight any of them. I know someone in town owns
    one.
  - Go search their houses just east of here, don't worry, they aren't going to care.
