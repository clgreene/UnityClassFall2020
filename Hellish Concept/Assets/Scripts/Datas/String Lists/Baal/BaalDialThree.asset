  - ...F To Talk...
  - Alrighty, so you've got a shovel now I see. Well, time to start digging.
  - Your hellspawn will come out to fight as soon as you're attacked.
  - 'Just tell it what to do and you''ll be fine. '
  - 'If your hellspawn dies you''ll have to get it reincarnated in town at the necromancers
    shop. '
  - The only way back to your throne now is past the gym just north of here.
  - The gym leader holds the key to the lower levels of hell, you'll have to beat
    him.
  - Before you go bounding over there you'll need to level up your beast first.
  - I'm sure the townsfolk will have some ideas on how you can do that.
  - Mostly it involes battling more monsters.
  - Alright kid, that's all I got for you. When you get back to your throne remember
    me.
