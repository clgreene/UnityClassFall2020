  - Hey, you want to go fight in the gym right?
  - Well, only way for you to do that is if I recommend you as a worthy fighter.
  - But I can't tell if you are or not.
  - So to prove yourself, why don't you go kill the ogre just east of town.
  - That would prove you're a real fighter.
  - ...plus get rid of our ogre problem...
