  - You look like a fighter to me...
  - Say, if you've got a hellspawn at your disposal, mind doing me a favor?
  - See, I live right near these rocks, and there are all these leeches hiding in
    'em.
  - If you were to kill off a bunch of them for me I'd recommend you to the hellspawn
    gym.
  - They only fight those who the townfolk here recommend see.
  - And we don't get a lot of newcomers who want to fight.
